            <p>My name is Jonah Schwartzman, and I am a graduate from WashU with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science + Mathematics. I grew up in Mill Valley, California and graduated Tamalpais High School in 2021. I am <span id="ageDiv"></span> years old.
              This is a website built entirely by me to showcase myself and things I am proud of.
              The quality of this website thus reflects my web development skills, and I hope to maintain a high quality website.
            </p>
            <p>Growing up in Mill Valley, I played baseball through high school.
               I began skateboarding around 16, as you can see in the Videos section, which I have enjoyed since. I have played golf since I was quite young, but have never played comptetitively.</p>
